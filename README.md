#Task 2: Image Generation with Pre-Trained Models

#Description
This project demonstrates how to generate images from text prompts using pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. The notebook provides step-by-step explanations for beginners to understand how the model works and how to generate images in Google Colab.

#Key Features
1.Uses StableDiffusionPipeline from the diffusers library.
2.Generates images based on user-defined text prompts.
3.Runs on Google Colab, supports CPU and GPU.
4.Outputs can be saved locally or organized in a folder (outputs/).
